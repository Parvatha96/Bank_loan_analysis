# Bank_loan_analysis
### Project Overview
The Bank Loan report makes monitoring and assessing the bank's lending activities and performance easier. This report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help us make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.
### Data Source
The loan data for this project is available in "financial_loan.csv" and it has comprehensive information about the bank's lending activities. The dataset has 38577 instances and rows from A to X. 
### Tools:
 I have attempted to construct the same dashboard using both **Tableau** and **Excel**. This is because making the same in different tools help us learn things better and get good hands on experience. Dynamic and interactive visualizations are crafted to present key findings effectively.
